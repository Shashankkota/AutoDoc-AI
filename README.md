# 🧠 AutoDoc AI

**AutoDoc AI** is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates high-quality software documentation — including a `README.md` and a complete Product Requirement Document (PRD) — from just a project title.

Built using **Streamlit** and the **Groq API** (powered by blazing-fast LLMs like Mixtral and LLaMA), AutoDoc AI saves time for developers, startups, students, and product teams by generating ready-to-use documentation in seconds.
